## Introduction
C is a widely-used, general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency,
portability, and low-level control. It has been the foundation for many operating systems,
embedded systems, and software applications. This README aims to provide a brief overview 
of fundamental concepts in C programming.

## Getting Started
Before diving into C programming, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
Common choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Unix-like systems and Visual C++ for Windows.

## Basic Syntax
C programs consist of functions containing statements. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
